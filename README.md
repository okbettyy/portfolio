# 🖥️ Portfolio OS — Windows 98 Web Portfolio

A retro Windows 98–style portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** using the nostalgic **98.css** UI framework.

The goal of this project is to turn my portfolio into an interactive desktop experience — where visitors can explore my work through folders, files, and apps just like a real operating system.
